One statistical technique for simulating the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables is called linear regression. 
By fitting a linear equation to the data, it seeks to forecast the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.

Simple linear regression uses a single independent variable, whereas multiple linear regression uses several independent variables. 
These two forms of linear regression are known as regression. Linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, residual normality, and (in the case of multiple regression) the absence of multicollinearity are the fundamental presumptions of linear regression.
